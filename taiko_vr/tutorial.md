# Tutorial

Hit the center (red part of the drumb) when the red spheres intersect with the gray judgement line.
Hit the edge (blue part of the drumb) when the blue spheres intersect with the gray judgement line.

## Scoring

If you hit the correct part of the drumb on time, you get a `Perfect`.
If your timing is slightly off, you get a `OK`.
If your timing is too far off, you hit the wrong part of the drumb, or you did not hit the drumb, you get a `Miss`.

Based on the number of `Perfect`s, `OK`s, and `Miss`s your final score is calculated.

## Non-VR mode controls

### Menus

You can use menus by holding `Shift+Q` while moving the mouse to change where the left controller points to.
You can then do a normal left-click to activate a button that the laser points to.
More key bindings working in menus can be found on the [Godot XR Simulator page](https://github.com/Cafezinhu/godot-vr-simulator?tab=readme-ov-file#camera-controls).


### Taiko VR

You can press certain keys to simulate hitting the drumb:

- `A`: Hit edge with left controller
- `S`: Hit center with left controller
- `D`: Hit center with right controller
- `F`: Hit edge with right controller
